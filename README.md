# Altered Underwater Imaging along Indian Coasts Using Hyper-Resolution
<h3>Overview</h3> 
This project proposes a Hyper-resolution Generative Framework (HGF) to enhance underwater images captured along the Indian coastline. Underwater imaging in India faces unique challenges like high turbidity, sedimentation, and wavelength-dependent light absorption. Traditional enhancement methods struggle in such conditions. Our deep learning framework uses:

* Multi-Level Degradation Restoration Generator (MLDRG) for noise removal and color correction.

* High-Frequency Learning Module (HFLM) for texture refinement and resolution boost.

Together, they deliver clear, high-resolution underwater visuals that improve marine biodiversity monitoring, resource mapping, and disaster management.

----------
<h3>Key Features</h3>

* End-to-End Restoration & Super-Resolution in one pipeline.

* Attention Mechanisms (Channel & Self-Attention) for focused enhancement.

* Region-Specific Training with datasets from Indian coasts (Goa, Kerala, Sundarbans).

* Validated using PSNR, SSIM, CICI.
